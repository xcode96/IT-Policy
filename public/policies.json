Overview\n\nSee **Purpose**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Purpose\n\nThis policy defines the acceptable use, approval requirements, and security procedures for **analog and ISDN lines** at `<Company Name>`. It covers two distinct use cases:\n- Lines used **exclusively for fax transmission/reception**  \n- Lines **connected to computers or intelligent devices**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nThis policy applies **only** to analog/ISDN lines connected **inside `<Company Name>` buildings or testing sites**.\n\nIt **does not apply** to:\n- Lines connected to **employee homes**  \n- **PBX desktop phones**  \n- Lines used by **Telecom for emergency or non-corporate purposes**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Policy\n\n### 4.1 Security Scenarios & Business Impact\n\nTwo primary threat scenarios justify this policy:\n\n1. **External Attack via Modem**:  \n   An attacker dials analog numbers hoping to reach a computer with an **auto-answering modem**. If successful, they may:\n   - Bypass network monitoring  \n   - Compromise internal systems  \n   - Steal sensitive corporate data (potentially worth millions)\n\n2. **Internal Physical Access + Data Exfiltration**:  \n   An intruder with physical access uses a **modem-equipped computer** to:\n   - Connect to `<Company Name>`’s trusted network via Ethernet  \n   - Dial out via modem to an external site  \n   - **Exfiltrate data** to an unmonitored location\n\nThese risks necessitate strict controls on analog/ISDN line usage.\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 Facsimile (Fax) Machines\n\n#### General Rules:\n- Fax lines are approved **for departmental use only**  \n- **No personal fax lines** permitted  \n- **No analog lines in personal cubicles**  \n- Fax machines must be placed in a **centralized administrative area**, **away from computer equipment**  \n- **Computers must not be used as fax devices** over analog lines\n\n> **Waivers** may be granted case-by-case based on business need, data sensitivity, and security posture.\n\n#### Conditions for Use:\nIf approved, the authorized user **must** ensure:\n- The line is used **only as specified in the request**  \n- **Only authorized personnel** have access  \n- When **not in use**, the line is **physically disconnected** from the computer  \n- When **in use**, the computer is **disconnected from `<Company Name>`’s internal network**  \n- Use is **strictly for company business** (no personal use)  \n- All downloaded material is **scanned with an approved, up-to-date antivirus utility** (e.g., McAfee VirusScan) before introduction to company systems\n\n---\n\n### 4.3 Computer-to-Analog/ISDN Line Connections\n\n- **General Rule**: **No approval** will be granted to connect computers or intelligent devices to analog/ISDN lines due to **significant security risks**.  \n- **Waivers** are considered **only on a case-by-case basis**.  \n- **Replacement lines** (e.g., after a move) are treated as **new requests** and subject to the same review.\n\n> ⚠️ Active attacks against such lines have been documented in the wild.\n\n---\n\n### 4.4 Requesting an Analog/ISDN Line\n\nAfter **manager approval**, the requester must submit the following to **Telecom**:\n\n#### Required Information:\n- A **detailed business case** explaining why secure alternatives (e.g., corporate Internet, dial-out pools) cannot be used  \n- The **business purpose** of the line  \n- **Hardware and software** to be connected  \n- **External systems** the line will access  \n\n#### Business Case Must Address:\n- What business function requires this line?  \n- Why can’t a standard `<Company Name>` desktop with Internet fulfill this need?  \n- Why can’t the existing corporate **dial-out access pool** be used?\n\n#### Security Profile Questions (Must Be Answered):\n- Will the machine be **physically disconnected** from the internal network when using the line?  \n- Where will the line be installed? (Cubicle? Lab?)  \n- Is **dial-in access from outside** required?  \n- How many lines/users? Frequency of use?  \n- What is the **earliest termination date**? (Line must be disconnected when no longer needed)  \n- What **additional controls** prevent unauthorized use?  \n- If a replacement line: What was the **original purpose**?  \n- What **protocols** will run over the line?  \n- Will an **approved antivirus scanner** be installed and maintained?\n\n> 📝 **All requests must use the official _Analog/ISDN Line Request Form_**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Policy Compliance\n\n### 5.1 Compliance Measurement  \nThe Infosec team verifies compliance through:\n- Business tool reports  \n- Internal and external audits  \n- Feedback to the policy owner  \n\n### 5.2 Exceptions  \nAll exceptions require **advance written approval** from the Infosec team.\n\n### 5.3 Non-Compliance  \nViolations may result in **disciplinary action**, up to and including **termination of employment**.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Overview\n\nA Clean Desk Policy is a critical physical security control that helps ensure all **sensitive or confidential materials**—whether physical or digital—are **secured and out of sight** when not in use or when an employee leaves their workstation.  \n\nThis policy:\n- Reduces the risk of **unauthorized access**, **data theft**, and **security breaches**  \n- Increases employee **awareness of information protection responsibilities**  \n- Supports compliance with standards such as **ISO/IEC 27001** and **ISO/IEC 27002 (formerly 17799)**  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Purpose\n\nTo establish **minimum requirements** for maintaining a “clean desk” environment where sensitive information—including data about employees, intellectual property, customers, and vendors—is **securely stored** and **not visible** to unauthorized individuals.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nApplies to **all `<Company Name>` employees and affiliates**, including contractors, consultants, and temporary staff, regardless of work location (office, remote, or hybrid).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Policy Requirements\n\nAll personnel **must** comply with the following:\n\n- **4.1** Secure all **sensitive/confidential information** (hardcopy or electronic) in locked storage at the **end of each workday** and whenever **away for an extended period**.  \n- **4.2** **Lock computer workstations** whenever the workspace is unoccupied—even briefly.  \n- **4.3** **Shut down computers completely** at the end of the workday (unless business continuity requires otherwise with Infosec approval).  \n- **4.4** Remove all **Restricted or Sensitive information** from desks and **lock it in a drawer** when unattended or at day’s end.  \n- **4.5** Keep **file cabinets containing sensitive data closed and locked** when not in active use or unattended.  \n- **4.6** **Never leave keys** to locked drawers, cabinets, or offices **on or near an unattended desk**.  \n- **4.7** **Secure laptops** using a **locking cable** or store them in a **locked drawer or cabinet**.  \n- **4.8** **Do not write down passwords** on sticky notes, paper, or in unsecured digital files. Passwords must **never be visible** on or under devices.  \n- **4.9** **Immediately retrieve printouts** containing Restricted or Sensitive information from printers.  \n- **4.10** Dispose of sensitive documents only in **official shredder bins** or **locked confidential disposal bins**—**never in regular trash**.  \n- **4.11** **Erase whiteboards** that display Restricted or Sensitive information when no longer needed.  \n- **4.12** **Lock away portable computing devices** (e.g., laptops, tablets) when not in use.  \n- **4.13** Treat **removable media** (USB drives, CDs, DVDs) as sensitive and store them in **locked drawers**.  \n\n> 🖨️ **Additional Guidance**:  \n> All printers and fax machines must be **cleared of output immediately** to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive documents left in output trays.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Policy Compliance\n\n### 5.1 Compliance Measurement  \nThe Infosec team verifies compliance through:\n- Periodic **walk-throughs**  \n- **Video monitoring** (where permitted)  \n- **Business tool reports**  \n- **Internal and external audits**  \n- **Feedback to the policy owner**\n\n### 5.2 Exceptions  \nAll exceptions require **advance written approval** from the **Infosec team**.\n\n### 5.3 Non-Compliance  \nViolations may result in **disciplinary action**, up to and including **termination of employment**.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

All or parts of this policy may be freely used by your organization without prior approval.  \n> To contribute updates or new policies, email: **policy-resources@sans.org**  \n> **Status**: Retired  \n> **Last Updated**: December 2013\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis policy establishes security configuration requirements for all communication equipment integrated into `<Company Name>`’s data network to protect against unauthorized access, data interception, and system compromise.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Purpose\n\nTo define the minimum security standards for the configuration, access control, and monitoring of **communication equipment** (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls, gateways) used within `<Company Name>`.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nApplies to **all communication equipment** that is part of `<Company Name>`’s **data network infrastructure**, regardless of vendor, location, or ownership.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Policy\n\n### 4.1 Security Configuration & Role-Based Access\n- All required **security features must be enabled** before equipment is placed into service.  \n- Only two user roles are permitted:\n  - **Monitoring**: Read-only access  \n  - **Administrator**: Full configuration privileges  \n- **All user commands and security-relevant events** must be **logged** for audit and incident response.\n\n### 4.2 Centralized Authentication\n- **Local user accounts are prohibited** on communication equipment.  \n- All users **must authenticate** through a **central user repository** (e.g., RADIUS, TACACS+, LDAP) using a protocol that **minimizes identity theft risk** (e.g., avoiding plaintext protocols like Telnet).\n\n### 4.3 Encrypted Communications\n- **All data transmitted** from the device (e.g., management traffic, logs, configuration backups) **must be encrypted** using a **strong encryption algorithm** to prevent:\n  - **Eavesdropping**  \n  - **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks**\n\n> 🔍 **Key Definitions** (from [SANS Glossary](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/)):  \n> - **Eavesdropping**: Unauthorized interception of data transmitted over a network.  \n> - **Man-in-the-middle Attack**: An attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.  \n> - **Strong Encryption**: Cryptographic methods that are computationally infeasible to break with current technology (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.2+).\n\n### 4.4 Log Retention & Integrity\n- **Event logs** must be stored on media included in the organization’s **regular backup process**.  \n- Backup procedures **must preserve log integrity**—logs **must not be altered or tampered with**.\n\n### 4.5 Administrator Password Management\n- The **local administrator password** must **not be known** by any operational staff.  \n- If emergency access is required:\n  1. Submit a formal request to the **Internal Security Division**  \n  2. Include **business justification** and complete required forms  \n  3. After use, the password **must be immediately reset** by the highest-level administrator  \n\n> This ensures **break-glass** access is **auditable, justified, and temporary**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Policy Compliance\n\n### 5.1 Compliance Measurement  \nThe Infosec Team verifies compliance through:\n- Periodic walk-throughs  \n- Video monitoring (where applicable)  \n- Business tool reports  \n- Internal and external audits  \n- Feedback to the policy owner  \n\n### 5.2 Exceptions  \nAll exceptions require **advance written approval** from the **Infosec Team**.\n\n### 5.3 Non-Compliance  \nViolations may result in **disciplinary action**, up to and including **termination of employment**.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Related Standards, Policies and Processes\n\n_None._\n\n---\n\n## 7. Definitions and Terms\n\nThe following terms are defined in the **[SANS Glossary of Terms](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/)**:\n- **Eavesdropping**  \n- **Man-in-the-middle Attack**  \n- **Strong Encryption**\n\n---\n\n## 8.
