Overview\n\nSee [Purpose](#2-purpose).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to provide guidance that limits the use of encryption to those algorithms that have received substantial public review and have been proven to work effectively. Additionally, this policy provides direction to ensure that Federal regulations are followed, and legal authority is granted for the dissemination and use of encryption technologies outside of the United States.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all `<Company Name>` employees and affiliates.\n\n> **Note**: Replace `<Company Name>` with your organization’s actual name when implementing this policy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Policy\n\n### 4.1 Algorithm Requirements\n\n#### 4.1.1 Symmetric Encryption\nCiphers in use must meet or exceed the set defined as \"AES-compatible\" or \"partially AES-compatible\" according to the [IETF/IRTF Cipher Catalog](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/irtf-cfrg/about/), or the set defined for use in the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication [FIPS 140-2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final), or any superseding documents according to the date of implementation.  \n**The use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is strongly recommended for symmetric encryption.**\n\n#### 4.1.2 Asymmetric Encryption\nAlgorithms in use must meet the standards defined for use in NIST publication [FIPS 140-2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final) or any superseding document, according to date of implementation.  \n**The use of the RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms is strongly recommended for asymmetric encryption.**\n\n#### 4.1.3 Signature Algorithms\n\n| Algorithm | Key Length (min) | Additional Comment |\n|----------|------------------|--------------------|\n| ECDSA P-256 | — | Consider [RFC 6090](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6090) to avoid patent infringement. |\n| RSA | 2048 bits | Must use a secure padding scheme. PKCS#7 padding scheme is recommended. Message hashing required. |\n| LDWM | SHA256 | Refer to [LDWM Hash-based Signatures Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mcgrew-hash-sigs) |\n\n### 4.2 Hash Function Requirements\n\nIn general, `<Company Name>` adheres to the [NIST Policy on Hash Functions](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/hash-functions).\n\n### 4.3 Key Agreement and Authentication\n\n- **4.3.1** Key exchanges must use one of the following cryptographic protocols:  \n  - Diffie-Hellman  \n  - IKE (Internet Key Exchange)  \n  - Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)\n\n- **4.3.2** Endpoints must be authenticated prior to the exchange or derivation of session keys.\n\n- **4.3.3** Public keys used to establish trust must be authenticated prior to use. Examples of authentication include:\n  - Transmission via cryptographically signed message\n  - Manual verification of the public key hash\n\n- **4.3.4** All servers used for authentication (e.g., RADIUS or TACACS) must have a valid certificate signed by a known trusted provider.\n\n- **4.3.5** All servers and applications using SSL or TLS must have certificates signed by a known, trusted provider.\n\n### 4.4 Key Generation\n\n- **4.4.1** Cryptographic keys must be generated and stored in a secure manner that prevents loss, theft, or compromise.\n\n- **4.4.2** Key generation must be seeded from an industry-standard Random Number Generator (RNG).  \n  For examples, see **NIST Annex C: Approved Random Number Generators for FIPS PUB 140-2** ([link](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final)).\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Overview\n\nSee **Purpose**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Purpose\n\nThis policy defines the acceptable use, approval requirements, and security procedures for **analog and ISDN lines** at `<Company Name>`. It covers two distinct use cases:\n- Lines used **exclusively for fax transmission/reception**  \n- Lines **connected to computers or intelligent devices**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nThis policy applies **only** to analog/ISDN lines connected **inside `<Company Name>` buildings or testing sites**.\n\nIt **does not apply** to:\n- Lines connected to **employee homes**  \n- **PBX desktop phones**  \n- Lines used by **Telecom for emergency or non-corporate purposes**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Policy\n\n### 4.1 Security Scenarios & Business Impact\n\nTwo primary threat scenarios justify this policy:\n\n1. **External Attack via Modem**:  \n   An attacker dials analog numbers hoping to reach a computer with an **auto-answering modem**. If successful, they may:\n   - Bypass network monitoring  \n   - Compromise internal systems  \n   - Steal sensitive corporate data (potentially worth millions)\n\n2. **Internal Physical Access + Data Exfiltration**:  \n   An intruder with physical access uses a **modem-equipped computer** to:\n   - Connect to `<Company Name>`’s trusted network via Ethernet  \n   - Dial out via modem to an external site  \n   - **Exfiltrate data** to an unmonitored location\n\nThese risks necessitate strict controls on analog/ISDN line usage.\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 Facsimile (Fax) Machines\n\n#### General Rules:\n- Fax lines are approved **for departmental use only**  \n- **No personal fax lines** permitted  \n- **No analog lines in personal cubicles**  \n- Fax machines must be placed in a **centralized administrative area**, **away from computer equipment**  \n- **Computers must not be used as fax devices** over analog lines\n\n> **Waivers** may be granted case-by-case based on business need, data sensitivity, and security posture.\n\n#### Conditions for Use:\nIf approved, the authorized user **must** ensure:\n- The line is used **only as specified in the request**  \n- **Only authorized personnel** have access  \n- When **not in use**, the line is **physically disconnected** from the computer  \n- When **in use**, the computer is **disconnected from `<Company Name>`’s internal network**  \n- Use is **strictly for company business** (no personal use)  \n- All downloaded material is **scanned with an approved, up-to-date antivirus utility** (e.g., McAfee VirusScan) before introduction to company systems\n\n---\n\n### 4.3 Computer-to-Analog/ISDN Line Connections\n\n- **General Rule**: **No approval** will be granted to connect computers or intelligent devices to analog/ISDN lines due to **significant security risks**.  \n- **Waivers** are considered **only on a case-by-case basis**.  \n- **Replacement lines** (e.g., after a move) are treated as **new requests** and subject to the same review.\n\n> ⚠️ Active attacks against such lines have been documented in the wild.\n\n---\n\n### 4.4 Requesting an Analog/ISDN Line\n\nAfter **manager approval**, the requester must submit the following to **Telecom**:\n\n#### Required Information:\n- A **detailed business case** explaining why secure alternatives (e.g., corporate Internet, dial-out pools) cannot be used  \n- The **business purpose** of the line  \n- **Hardware and software** to be connected  \n- **External systems** the line will access  \n\n#### Business Case Must Address:\n- What business function requires this line?  \n- Why can’t a standard `<Company Name>` desktop with Internet fulfill this need?  \n- Why can’t the existing corporate **dial-out access pool** be used?\n\n#### Security Profile Questions (Must Be Answered):\n- Will the machine be **physically disconnected** from the internal network when using the line?  \n- Where will the line be installed? (Cubicle? Lab?)  \n- Is **dial-in access from outside** required?  \n- How many lines/users? Frequency of use?  \n- What is the **earliest termination date**? (Line must be disconnected when no longer needed)  \n- What **additional controls** prevent unauthorized use?  \n- If a replacement line: What was the **original purpose**?  \n- What **protocols** will run over the line?  \n- Will an **approved antivirus scanner** be installed and maintained?\n\n> 📝 **All requests must use the official _Analog/ISDN Line Request Form_**.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

All or parts of this policy can be freely used for your organization. There is no prior approval required. If you would like to contribute a new policy or updated version of this policy, please send email to [policy-resources@sans.org](mailto:policy-resources@sans.org).  \n> **Last Update Status**: Updated June 2014  \n> © SANS Institute 2014 – All Rights Reserved\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nLogging from **critical systems, applications, and services** provides essential data for detecting anomalies, investigating incidents, and conducting **forensic analysis**. While logs may not be reviewed daily, their availability is **critical** for security, compliance, and operational integrity.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Purpose\n\nThis standard defines **minimum audit logging requirements** for information systems to ensure they:\n\n- Generate meaningful, actionable logs  \n- Integrate effectively with enterprise **log management** functions  \n\nThis language is designed to be incorporated into:\n- Enterprise IT security policies  \n- Procurement standards  \n- RFP/RFQ templates  \n\n> ✅ Ensures that **both in-house and vendor-procured systems** support necessary logging capabilities.\n\n> **Note**: Replace `<Company Name>` with your actual organization name when implementing.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nThis standard applies to **all production systems** on the `<Company Name>` network, including:\n- Servers  \n- Applications  \n- Network devices  \n- Cloud workloads  \n- Security appliances  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Standard\n\n### 4.1 General Requirements\n\nAll systems that:\n- Handle **confidential information**,  \n- Accept **network connections**, or  \n- Make **access control decisions** (authentication/authorization)  \n\n**must record and retain audit logs** sufficient to answer the following **7 key questions**:\n\n1. **What** activity was performed?  \n2. **Who or what** performed it? (including source system/IP)  \n3. **What** was the activity performed **on**? (target object)  \n4. **When** was it performed?  \n5. **What tool(s)** were used?  \n6. **What was the outcome**? (success/failure/error)  \n7. *(Implied)* **Why** was it allowed or denied?\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 Activities to Be Logged\n\nLogs **must be generated** for the following events:\n\n1. **Create, read, update, or delete** confidential information (including passwords)  \n2. **Create, update, or delete** non-confidential data  \n3. **Initiate** a network connection  \n4. **Accept** a network connection  \n5. **User authentication/authorization** (e.g., login, logout)  \n6. **Grant, modify, or revoke access rights**, including:\n   - Adding users/groups  \n   - Changing privileges  \n   - Modifying file/database permissions  \n   - Updating firewall rules  \n   - Password changes  \n7. **System, network, or service configuration changes**, including:\n   - Software installations/updates  \n   - Patch deployment  \n8. **Application process startup, shutdown, or restart**  \n9. **Application failures or abnormal terminations**, especially due to:\n   - Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk, bandwidth)  \n   - Service failures (e.g., DNS, DHCP)  \n   - Hardware faults  \n10. **Detection of suspicious/malicious activity** by:\n    - IDS/IPS  \n    - Anti-virus  \n    - Anti-malware or EDR systems  \n\n---\n\n### 4.3 Required Log Elements\n\nEach log entry **must contain or unambiguously infer** the following elements:\n\n| Element | Examples |\n|--------|--------|\n| **1. Type of action** | `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `accept-connection` |\n| **2. Subsystem** | Process name, transaction ID, service name |\n| **3. Subject identifiers** | Username, hostname, **IP address**, **MAC address** *(standardized for correlation)* |\n| **4. Object identifiers** | Filename, database record ID, query parameters, IP/MAC *(standardized)* |\n| **5. Before/after values** | For updates (if feasible) |\n| **6. Timestamp** | With **timezone** (preferably UTC) |\n| **7. Access decision** | `allowed` or `denied` |\n| **8. Denial reason** | Error code, policy violation description |\n\n> 🔍 **Note**: \"Indirectly\" means the value can be reliably derived from other logged data.\n\n---\n\n### 4.4 Formatting and Storage\n\nSystems **must support log formatting and storage** that ensures:\n- **Log integrity**  \n- **Enterprise-level analysis and reporting**\n\n✅ **Approved Logging Mechanisms Include**:\n\n1. **Microsoft Windows Event Logs** → collected by a centralized log management system  \n2. **Syslog / syslog-ng / syslog-reliable** → sent to a centralized log management system  \n3. **ANSI-SQL database logs** → where the database itself complies with this standard  \n4. **Open standards** such as:\n   - **ArcSight CEF** (Common Event Format)  \n   - **IDMEF** (Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format)  \n   - **Check Point OPSEC**  \n   - **CEF, LEEF, or JSON-based structured logging**\n\n> 📌 **Note**: The design of the enterprise log management system itself is **outside the scope** of this standard.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Policy Compliance\n\n### 5.1 Compliance Measurement  \nThe Infosec team will verify compliance through:\n- System configuration reviews  \n- Log sample audits  \n- Internal/external assessments  \n- Procurement validation (for new systems)\n\n### 5.2 Exceptions  \nAll exceptions require **prior written approval** from the Infosec team.\n\n### 5.3 Non-Compliance  \nViolations may result in:\n- **Disciplinary action**, up to and including **termination of employment**  \n- **Rejection of non-compliant systems** in procurement\n\n---\n\n## 6. Related Standards, Policies and Processes\n\n- **[Incident Response Policy](#)**  \n- **[Data Classification Policy](#)**  \n- **[System Hardening Standards](#)**  \n- **[Log Retention Policy](#)**\n\n> *(Link to your organization’s internal policies as applicable.)*\n\n---\n\n## 7. Definitions and Terms\n\nWhile no definitions were listed in the original document, the following terms are relevant:\n\n| Term | Definition (per [SANS Glossary](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/)) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Audit Log** | A chronological record of system activities used for compliance, forensics, and monitoring. |\n| **Confidential Information** | Data that must be protected from unauthorized access (e.g., PII, financial records). |\n| **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** | A system that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. |\n\n> 🔗 Full definitions: [SANS Glossary of Terms](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/)\n\n---\n\n## 8.

Overview\n\nThis policy is intended for organizations **not classified as critical infrastructure** under U.S. federal guidelines. During a pandemic, public health authorities may require offices to close to non-essential personnel—or entirely—to reduce disease transmission.\n\nUnlike localized disasters (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes), a **global pandemic** cannot be mitigated by failover to a backup site. Extended workforce unavailability threatens business continuity and financial viability. Proactive planning for **remote work**, **personnel resilience**, and **operational adaptation** is essential to organizational survival.\n\n> **Note**: Replace `<Company Name>` with your actual organization name when implementing.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Purpose\n\nThis policy mandates **pandemic-specific planning** beyond standard Business Continuity (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DRP) processes. It addresses the unique challenge that **a significant portion—or all—of the workforce may be unable to work on-site** due to illness, caregiving duties, or public health mandates.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Scope\n\n- **Planning Phase**: Involves BCP/DRP teams, enterprise architects, and senior leadership of `<Company Name>`.  \n- **Implementation Phase**: Applies to **all employees and contractors**, who must complete required training before and during an outbreak.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Policy\n\n`<Company Name>` will **authorize, develop, and maintain** a Pandemic Response Plan addressing the following:\n\n### 4.1 Leadership & Succession\n- A **dedicated Pandemic Response Team** will lead plan development and updates.  \n- The team must develop **internal expertise** on disease transmission, waves, and public health guidance.  \n- **Trained alternates** must be designated for all leadership roles to ensure continuity if primary members become unavailable.\n\n### 4.2 Communications Plan\n- Develop a **resilient communication strategy** accounting for potential telecom congestion (e.g., SMS, email, collaboration tools, satellite phones).\n\n### 4.3 Situational Awareness & Alerting\n- Monitor authoritative sources for early warnings:\n  - World Health Organization (WHO)  \n  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  \n  - Federal, state, and local public health agencies\n\n### 4.4 Emergency Policies (Tiered by Severity)\nPredefined policies will **temporarily override standard operations** during a declared pandemic, scaled to disruption levels:\n\n| Area | Policy Focus |\n|------|-------------|\n| **a) Payroll** | How employees will be compensated |\n| **b) Work Location** | Remote work; allowances for childcare (e.g., bringing children to work if essential) |\n| **c) Task Execution** | Tools and processes for remote productivity |\n| **d) Suspended Activities** | Non-essential functions to pause |\n| **e) Communication Cadence** | Frequency and channels for leadership updates |\n| **f) Alternate Comms** | Backup methods if primary systems fail |\n| **g) Operational Adjustments** | Changes to visitor policies, events, facilities access |\n\n### 4.5 Response Triggers\n- Define **clear indicators** (e.g., WHO Pandemic Phase, local infection rates) to activate response levels.  \n- Ensure **graduated escalation** aligned with public health guidance.\n\n### 4.6 Employee Health & Safety Training\nAll personnel must be trained on:\n- **Symptoms** of exposure  \n- Risks of **disease clusters** (schools, daycares, gatherings)  \n- **Prevention**:  \n  - Maintain 6+ feet distance  \n  - Cover coughs/sneezes  \n  - Frequent handwashing  \n- **Stay-home protocols** (with encouragement, no penalty)  \n- **Travel restrictions** to high-risk areas\n\n### 4.7 High-Risk Employee Identification\n- Identify staff with:  \n  - Household members who are **first responders or medical personnel**  \n  - **Single-parent status**  \n- These individuals have higher risk of unavailability; plan accordingly.\n\n### 4.8 Critical Role Continuity\n- Map **key personnel** for each critical business function.  \n- Establish **succession plans** and cross-training to ensure continuity if staff fall ill.\n\n### 4.9 Essential Supplies\nMaintain or pre-contract supplies including:\n- Face masks, hand sanitizer  \n- Fuel, food, and water (for essential on-site staff)  \n- IT consumables (e.g., printer ink, cables)\n\n### 4.10 IT Preparedness\n- **Enterprise architects** must integrate pandemic scenarios into infrastructure planning.  \n- Verify capacity for **mass remote work**:  \n  - Bandwidth and VPN concentrator licensing  \n  - VoIP and laptop/remote desktop availability  \n- Expand use of **virtual meeting tools** (video, screen sharing)  \n- Identify **tasks that cannot be done remotely**  \n- Secure **vendor agreements** for emergency licensing flexibility  \n- Define **on-site IT staffing needs** for critical systems  \n- Plan for **altered customer interactions** (e.g., digital-only support)  \n- Set clear expectations on:  \n  - Printing work documents on **personal printers**  \n  - Sending work files to **personal email accounts** (generally prohibited)\n\n### 4.11 Plan Testing\n- Conduct **regular exercises** (tabletop, simulation) to validate the plan.\n\n### 4.12 Post-Exercise Review\n- Perform **retrospectives** to identify gaps and implement improvements.\n\n### 4.13 Plan Maintenance\n- Review and update the plan **at least annually**.  \n- Require **leadership sign-off** on all major revisions.\n\n### 4.14 Audit Guidance\n- Auditors must verify that **BCP, DRP, and enterprise architecture** reviews include assessment of alignment with this Pandemic Response Plan.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Policy Compliance\n\n### 5.1 Compliance Measurement  \nThe Infosec team will verify compliance through:\n- Plan documentation reviews  \n- Exercise participation records  \n- Internal/external audits  \n- Leadership attestations\n\n### 5.2 Exceptions  \nAll exceptions require **prior written approval** from **`<company leadership>`** and **annual revalidation**.\n\n### 5.3 Non-Compliance  \nViolations may result in:\n- **Disciplinary action**, up to and including **termination of employment**\n\n---\n\n## 6.
