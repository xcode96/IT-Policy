All or parts of this policy can be freely used for your organization. \nThere is no prior approval required. If you would like to contribute a new policy or \nupdated version of this policy, please send email to policy-resources@sans.org. \nLast Update Status: Updated June 2014 \n1. Overview \nSee Purpose. \n2. Purpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to provide guidance that limits the use of encryption to those \nalgorithms that have received substantial public review and have been proven to work \neffectively. Additionally, this policy provides direction to ensure that Federal regulations are \nfollowed, and legal authority is granted for the dissemination and use of encryption technologies \noutside of the United States. \n3. Scope \nThis policy applies to all <Company Name> employees and affiliates. \n4. Policy \n4.1 Algorithm Requirements \n4.1.1 Ciphers in use must meet or exceed the set defined as \"AES-compatible\" or \n\"partially AES-compatible\" according to the IETF/IRTF Cipher Catalog, or the \nset defined for use in the United States National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) publication FIPS 140-2, or any superseding documents \naccording to the date of implementation. The use of the Advanced Encryption \nStandard (AES) is strongly recommended for symmetric encryption. \n4.1.2 Algorithms in use must meet the standards defined for use in NIST publication \nFIPS 140-2 or any superseding document, according to date of implementation. \nThe use of the RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms is \nstrongly recommended for asymmetric encryption. \n4.1.3 Signature Algorithms  \nAlgorithm \nKey Length \n(min) \nAdditional Comment \nECDSA P-256 Consider RFC6090 to avoid patent \ninfringement.   \nRSA \n2048 \nMust use a secure padding scheme. PKCS#7 \npadding scheme is recommended. Message \nhashing required. \nLDWM \nSHA256 \nRefer to LDWM Hash-based Signatures Draft \n4.2 Hash Function Requirements \nIn general, <Company Name> adheres to the NIST Policy on Hash Functions.  \n4.3 Key Agreement and Authentication \n4.3.1 Key exchanges must use one of the following cryptographic protocols: Diffie\nHellman, IKE, or Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH). \n4.3.2 End points must be authenticated prior to the exchange or derivation of session \nkeys. \n4.3.3 Public keys used to establish trust must be authenticated prior to use.  Examples \nof authentication include transmission via cryptographically signed message or \nmanual verification of the public key hash. \n4.3.4 All servers used for authentication (for example, RADIUS or TACACS) must \nhave installed a valid certificate signed by a known trusted provider. \n4.3.5 All servers and applications using SSL or TLS must have the certificates signed \nby a known, trusted provider.  \n4.4 Key Generation \n4.4.1 Cryptographic keys must be generated and stored in a secure manner that prevents \nloss, theft, or compromise.  \n4.4.2 Key generation must be seeded from an industry standard random number \ngenerator (RNG). For examples, see NIST Annex C: Approved Random Number \nGenerators for FIPS PUB 140-2.   \n5. Policy Compliance \n5.1 Compliance Measurement \nThe Infosec team will verify compliance to this policy through various methods, including but \nnot limited to, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and feedback to the policy \nowner.  \n5.2 Exceptions \nAny exception to the policy must be approved by the Infosec team in advance.  \n5.3 Non-Compliance \nAn employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and \nincluding termination of employment.  \n6 Related Standards, Policies and Processes \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication FIPS 140-2, \nNIST Policy on Hash Functions \n7 Definitions and Terms \nThe following definition and terms can be found in the SANS Glossary located at: \nhttps://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/ \nâ€¢ Proprietary Encryption \n8 Revision History \nDate of Change Responsible \nSummary of Change \nJune 2014 \nSANS Policy Team \nUpdated and converted to new format.\n"
